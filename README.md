# sql-syntax-challenge

In this challenge, we’re going to practice performing SQL queries. This should help better solidify some concepts that were covered during lecture.

## Assumptions

* You are using Postico
* You installed Postgres with homebrew
* Postgres is currently running on your computer

## Setup
Follow the instructions below before continuing with this challenge.

### Create your database, table, and data

We are creating a `bank` database with a single table (`accounts`) and 8 records. Please follow the instructions below to create a new database with this table and data.

1. Open Postico, if needed.
2. Connect to localhost.
3. Click on the `localhost` tab/bar in the upper-left corner.
4. Create a `bank` database
5. Double-click the `bank` database to use it.
6. Double-click the 'SQL Query' icon to bring up the query window.
7. Paste the following query into the query box to create the `accounts` table and populate it with data. Remember to click the `Execute query` button.

```
CREATE TABLE accounts (
    user_id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    username character varying(12),
    city character varying(128),
    transactions_completed integer,
    transactions_attempted integer,
    account_balance numeric(12,2)
);

INSERT INTO accounts (username, city, transactions_completed, transactions_attempted, account_balance) VALUES ('shawn', 'chicago', 5, 10, 355.80),
('cherise', 'minneapolis', 9, 9, 4000.00),
('larry', 'minneapolis', 3, 4, 77.01),
('dallas', 'new york', 6, 12, 0.99),
('anthony', 'chicago', 0, 0, 0.00),
('travis', 'miami', 1, 100, 500000.34),
('davey', 'chicago', 9, 99, 98.04),
('ora', 'phoenix', 88, 90, 3.33),
('grace', 'miami', 7, 9100, 34.78),
('hope', 'phoenix', 4, 10, 50.17);
```

### GitHub repo
1. Create a GitHub repo named “prime-solo-sql”. 
2. Create a file called “database.sql”. You will store your responses to the exercise questions here. NOTE: This is merely a text file with a .sql extension.

## Exercise

For each of the following questions

* Write a comment that specifies which question you are answering. (SQL comments are two dashes, followed by text.)
* Write the SQL query that answers the question, below that comment.

### Example question and answer
```
-- 0. Get all the users
SELECT * FROM accounts;
```

## Tasks
1. Get all users from Chicago.
2. Get all users with usernames that contain the letter a.
3. The bank is giving a new customer bonus! Update all records with an account balance of 0.00 and a transactions_attempted of 0. Give them a new account balance of 10.00.
4. Select all users that have attempted 9 or more transactions.
5. Get the username and account balance of the 3 users with the highest balances, sort highest to lowest balance. NOTE: Research LIMIT
6. Get the username and account balance of the 3 users with the lowest balances, sort lowest to highest balance.
7. Get all users with account balances that are more than $100.
8. Add a new record.
9. The bank is losing money in Miami and Phoenix and needs to unload low transaction customers: Delete users that reside in miami OR phoenix and have completed fewer than 5 transactions.
